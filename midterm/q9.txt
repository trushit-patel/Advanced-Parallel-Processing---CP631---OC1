The total time required by the modified algorithm to complete can be estimated as follows:

1. Computation Time: Each process finds the maximum values along each column in its local portion of the matrix.
Total computation time per process: Tcomp = (N^2 / p) * tmaxcomp

2. Communication Time: After computation, each process participates in an MPI_Reduce operation to find the global maximum values along each column.
Total communication time: Tcomm = N * log(p) * tcomm

3. Total Time: The total time required by the modified algorithm is the sum of computation and communication times.
Ttotal = Tcomp + Tcomm = (N^2 / p) * tmaxcomp + N * log(p) * tcomm
